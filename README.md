### What I learned

Happy to solve this project. Ive learnt images rsponsiveness, mobile responsiveness but im still on the learning curve.. 

 <img srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg 600w, images/image-product-mobile.jpg 686w"
            sizes="(max-width: 600px) 686px, 300px"
            src="images/image-product-desktop.jpg"
            alt="perfume product">
 
 This line of code actually helped a lot in my desktop image layout flow
 This also improved my image responsiveness

### Continued development

Mobile responsiveness gave me a hard time in this project. Wanna learn a lot about mobile responsiveness YEAH! wanna get pretty much better.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped a lot to understand mobile responsiveness to some extent
- [Example resource 2](https://https://imagify.io/blog/make-responsive-images/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand a lot on image responsiveness.

I really want to improve in my css skills especially in the aspect of mobile responsiveness. A better guide/material will do..
